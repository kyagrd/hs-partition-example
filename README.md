# hs-partition-example
An example using Haskell partition and FGL library to construct a lattice structure (as a FGL graph) of substutitions (as paritions) starting from the set where every element is distinct and finally down to where all elements are unified.
When you run `app/Main.hs` with ghci, Graphviz preview diagram will appear, which is also provided as a captured image below:
